# Growing Up



My child hood in my opinion was the best years of my life. I was advneturous, had no responsibilities, and played all day. When I was in elementary school every summer I went to my grandparents house. That's where I learned how to drive four wheelers, went camping, and a lot more of activities. I also loved to watch t.v (especially Disney channel). One of my favorite shows was *[Wizards of Wavery place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place)*. During 4th grade my family moved from Moberly to Columbia.
  During my middle school years I became more active in sports and continued playing basketball. During middle school I also tried volleyball and cheer. I would say middle school is where I was discovering more of my interests. 
  In highschool, I decided to stick with basketball but only played my freshman year. After some events happened in my life I decided to quit and focus more on school. During my Junior year of highschool is when covid hit and I had to get used to being online. I was on discord more and would be on there for hours playing games. I feel this is where I became more interested in being online.
