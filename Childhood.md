### Elementary School

My child hood in my opinion was the best years of my life. I was advneturous, had no responsibilities, and played all day. When I was in elementary school every summer I went to my grandparents house. That's where I learned how to drive four wheelers, went camping, and a lot more of activities. I also loved to watch t.v (especially Disney channel). One of my favorite shows was [Wizards of Wavery place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place). During 4th grade my family moved from Moberly to Columbia.




### Middle School

During my middle school years I became more active in sports and continued playing basketball but also tried cheer and volleyball.
