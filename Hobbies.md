# My Favorite Hobbies

## Art
I've always had a interest in art including drawing and painting. Although I don't have many projects I have done I would say I am pretty creative. My favorite things to paint are landscapes and I love to draw whatever I am feeling. I want to get into more realism art. In school I took my favorite class Digital Media where I learned a lot about Adobe cloud. This is where I gained my interest for illustrator and photoshop.

## Physical Activity

I also really enjoy beign active and being outisde. I usually try to go to the gym three times a week. I also like getting a bunch of people together and playing sand volleyball and other games. 

## Being with family

I am a family orineted person and love the Holidays because thats when my family comes together. I love celebrating little milestones within my family like birthdays, gender reveals, and accomplishments. I definitely would not be who I am and where I am without my family.
