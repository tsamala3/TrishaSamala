# My Favorite Hobbies

## Art
I've always had a interest in art including drawing and painting. Although I don't have many projects I have done I would say I am pretty creative. My favorite things to paint are landscapes and I love to draw whatever I am feeling. I want to get into more realism art. In school I took my favorite class Digital Media where I learned a lot about Adobe cloud. This is where I gained my interest for illustrator and photoshop.
